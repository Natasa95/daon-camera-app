# Front-End Coding Challenge: Video Preview & Timed Snapshot

This is a small single-page web application that uses the user's camera via the WebRTC `getUserMedia` API to show a live video preview and automatically capture a snapshot after a short delay.

## Tech Stack

- React (Vite template)
- Plain CSS for layout and basic styling
- No backend – everything runs in the browser

## How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
